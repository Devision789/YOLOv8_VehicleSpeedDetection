# YOLOv8 Vehicle Speed Detection

Welcome to our YOLOv8 Vehicle Speed Detection project repository! This project uses the YOLOv8 object detection system to accurately detect and track vehicles, and estimate their speeds on the road.

## Overview

Speed detection of vehicles in traffic videos is crucial for maintaining safety rules and regulations. 
Our YOLOv8 Vehicle Speed Detection system is capable of identifying vehicles, tracking their movements and estimating their speed in real-time or recorded video streams.

## Features

- Real-time vehicle detection: Our system uses YOLOv8 to detect and identify vehicles in a video stream.
- Vehicle tracking: Once a vehicle is detected, our system can track its movement across frames.
- Speed estimation: By comparing the change in position of a vehicle over time, our system can estimate its speed.
- Traffic rule enforcement: By accurately detecting and reporting over-speeding vehicles, our system can help enforce traffic rules and promote road safety.

## Installation 

Instructions for installing and setting up the system will be updated soon.
